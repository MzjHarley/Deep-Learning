# It's the pytorch version of transformer.   
The train.py is written to let the model implement the simple copy task, that is, the model's input and output are the same.  
The language_model_train.py is written to train the model to predict next word, it runs on CPU,uses Adam optimizer.
The language_model_train2.py is written to train the model to predict next word, it runs on GPU,uses SGD optimizer.
The language_model_train3.py is written to train the model to predict next word, it runs on GPU,uses SGD optimizer.
